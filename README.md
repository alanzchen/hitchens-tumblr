[Theme Preview](https://blog.zenan.ch)

# Installation

Open [index.html](https://github.com/alanzchen/hitchens-tumblr/blob/main/index.html), copy all source code, and paste them into the tumblr theme editor.

# Features

 - Text, Link, Q&A, and Chat post types.
 - Integration with Disqus and Google Analytics.
 - Search.
 - And all the good stuff from the original [Hitchens](https://github.com/patdryburgh/hitchens)

# Using Chat post type

To use the iMessage-like interface, start with `Me:` for a text bubble from you (blue), and `They:` for a text bubble from others (grey). To insert a non-conversational text (such as indicating who are talking), simply type without starting with `{Name}:`.
